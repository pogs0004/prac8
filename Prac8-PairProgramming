Review of Pair Programming 
------------------------------

Background
------------

Pair programming is a software development paradigm that involves the efforts of two programmers working on the same code. Both programmers work together one one console, each taking a different role of either a navigator or a driver. The navigator role can change depending on the current mode of development, however the main function of the navigator is to direct the driver as to how development should proceed. 

While the navigator directs, the driver creates the actual code concentrating on the physical and tactical approach to generating the software. The navigator oversees the driver and makes suggestions while the code is being entered. Additionally, the programmers should regularly swap roles after a predetermined time period or at specific small milestones in the development. 

Practical Challenge
--------------------

Our class was given a practical challenge to carry out a pair programming task. However, before we were to delve into a coding task, we began with a practice session. In this session we formed small groups and were provided with a list of words. We were required to use each of words in writing a short story using the pair programming approach. 

While every group managed to create some form of story, some very creative, I found that in the rush to get the job done in the time allocated, our group quickly fell into a collaboration mode. This highlighted an inherent difficulty in strictly adhering to the pair programming process, at least for those new to the concept. As such, the practice task turned out to be valuable preparation for the practical challenge, which would be a code based task.

The practical task was to develop a date parser programme that would be able to derive a date from a range of extremely different input data, from obvious date formats to verbose string inputs and other data seemingly indistinguishable as dates. The first problem for our pair was to select a programming language. With differing skills in the area we settled on programming in Java as being the best compromise; we also though we might be able to take advantage of Java's inbuilt calendar class to speed up development, it turns out we were wrong about that. 

Results
-------

While our pair did not make incredible progress on the task, mainly due to wasting time discovering the idiosyncrasies of the Java calendar class, the benefits of pair programming was definitely highlighted. While the driver coded out solutions the navigator quickly made strategic decisions to guide the team in finding quickest outcomes. We did not however swap roles as often as we should have which was due to a couple of factors. Firstly differences in our coding ability was a difficulty and secondly we found getting into a "groove" meant we were reluctant to stop mid flow to change roles. 

Summary
----------
The impression I have gained from my experience of the practical task is that pair programming is a method of software development that requires some practice to execute effectively. I also feel that pair programming, if undertaken correctly could aid in improving several areas of software development such as, software quality, individual learning, and team building. I would have liked this method of software development to be presented to me at an earlier stage in my degree as it would have likely proved beneficial, especially considering how many opportunities there has been for programming in groups of two.
